## Stars

Stars are some of the universe's most fascinating objects, each one a unique result of complex physical phenomena. They come in all shapes, sizes, and types, from massive blue supergiants to dim red dwarfs. The type of star can tell us a lot about its age, temperature, brightness, and even the elements it's made of.

## Data

Our data contains 241 entries, with each row representing one star. Every star in this dataset has the following key characteristics:

| Temperature | L (Luminosity) | R (Radius) | A_M (Absolute Magnitude) | Color | Spectral_Class | Type |

- **Temperature**: Surface temperature of the star.
- **L (Luminosity)**: Brightness of the star relative to the Sun.
- **R (Radius)**: Size of the star relative to the Sun.
- **A_M (Absolute Magnitude)**: A measure of the star’s brightness as observed from Earth.
- **Color**: Apparent color of the star, ranging from blue to red.
- **Spectral_Class**: Classification of the star based on its spectral lines (e.g., O, B, A, F, G, K, M).
- **Type**: The specific type/category of star based on its characteristics.

The aim here is to see if we can predict a star’s type just based on these physical attributes.

The type column indicates the type of star you are dealing with.

## Fun Facts about Stars

1. **Stars Can "Sing"**: Stars can actually vibrate in ways that resemble sound waves, a field of study known as asteroseismology. These vibrations help astronomers learn about a star's internal structure.
   
2. **Stars Live (and Die) in Spectacular Fashion**: Massive stars end their lives in colossal supernova explosions, scattering elements throughout the cosmos—these elements eventually form planets and even life.

3. **The Sun is Average, But Essential**: Despite being a modestly sized, G-type main-sequence star, the Sun's stable energy output makes it perfect for sustaining life on Earth.

## Your Task

For your first task, we encourage you to select one of the options below. They range from simple to more advanced. You can read about what points are, and how they are calculated <a href='guides/points'> here</a>.

All these submissions require a report. You can refer to the report writing guide <a href="/guides/report">here. </a>

### Simple: Star Charectaristics Report 
**Challenge Option**: Build a model that accurately predicts star type based on its characteristics, and write a concise report detailing your approach and findings.

###
**Complex**: Try produce a model that predicts star type based on a stars other features and write up a short rmd / qmd report on it.

###
**Simple**: If your stuck and looking for something simpler, try write up report on the types of charectaristics exhibited by each star type.


## Need a Hint?

If youre new to coding, you can filter a dataframe (csv object) using R Studio like this.
```{r data_loading_r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

data = read.csv('stars.csv')

filtered_for_type_1 = data |> filter(type = 1)
```


In Python you can use the Pandas library for simmilar operations.

```{python data_loading_py_2, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
import pandas as pd

stars = pd.read_csv('stars.csv')
stars = stars[stars['Type']==2]
```

For a no-code option you can use Excel.

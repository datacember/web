## Stars

Stars come in many types throught the galaxy, often a product of physical phenomena that 

## Data

The data consists of 241 complete entries, each one representing a star. Consequently, each star has the following charectaristics. 

| Temperature | L | R | A_M | Color | Spectral_Class | Type

The type column indicates the type of star you are dealing with. 

## Brief

*Youve just started a job as an intern at NASA, and your manager has thrown this on your desk. He expects a report on predicting `type` of a star, based just on its physical charectaristics. *

**Complex**: Try produce a model that predicts star type based on a stars other features and write up a short rmd / qmd report on it.

**Simple**: If your stuck and looking for something simpler, try write up report on the types of charectaristics exhibited by each star type.

## Need a Hint?

If youre using R Studio, you can filter a dataframe like this.
```{r data_loading echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

data = read.csv('stars.csv')

filtered_for_type_1 = data |> filter(type = 1)
```

In Python you can do some filtering on the fly when you traverse a dataframe
```{python data_loading}
temperature_means = dict() # initialize some empty data store
first_row = True

for line in open('stars.csv'):
  line = line.rstrip('\n').split(',')
  if type:=line[7]==5:
    # do something

```

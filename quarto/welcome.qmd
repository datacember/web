Hello!

Thank you for participating in Datacember! I hope that throughout this month, you’ll gain valuable experience through a few projects, push your knowledge further, and most importantly, have fun with this challenge.

By the end of the month, I hope you’ll have a project or two in modeling or exploratory data analysis (EDA) that you can be proud of.

This quickstart guide is here to help you get started by explaining how things will work, where to find everything, and what to expect.

## A little about the challenge

Datacember is a month-long data science challenge.
Each week, a new challenge with a unique dataset will be released to inspire your thinking in data science. You’ll have the week to complete the challenge and submit a report answering a few questions about your work. Upon submission, your work will be graded, and this process will repeat for all four weeks of December.

At the end of the challenge, we’ll showcase the best work and aim to produce fully-fledged reports on the data and the most interesting findings in a mock journal.

Refer to the sections below for a detailed understanding of how everything works.

The <a href="/">home page</a> will be your central hub for accessing everything—Discord, challenges, guides, and more.

## Prior Expectations

Entering this challenge, you’re expected to have basic coding experience, ideally in R, Python, or SQL. However, challenges are self-elected, and you can use any tool you prefer. *We care about your findings, not your methods.* Whether you work in Excel or want to learn Python with pandas, the choice is yours.

No prior knowledge of statistics or data science is assumed. Take the challenges at your own pace—this is a chance to learn and explore. For resources, check the footer of this page, and feel free to ask questions on Discord.

## Challenges

Challenges are released weekly, with all the information you need to start your data science journey. The first challenge is <a href="challenge/stars">out now!</a>

Each challenge has 3 difficulty levels: **easy**, **medium**, and **hard**, plus an optional **wildcard** stream. Choose the one that resonates with you or fits your skills best.

### Data in the Challenges

Each challenge brief (<a href="/">found on the home page</a>) contains information on where to find the data. Sometimes you'll need to download it, and other times you’ll use SQL to access a database.

Most data is 'structured', with one week focused on 'unstructured' data. Additionally, two weeks cover time series data, so it’s a great opportunity to dive deep into time series modeling techniques.

### What to do in the Challenges

Each challenge provides a general guide on what to do. Once you've chosen your challenge stream, you can research and decide how to approach it, or dive right in if you already know your strategy.

If you're stuck and need more hints, ask on the Discord server or message me directly.

### What to Do once Ive finished the challenge

Once you have completed your coding section or analysis, if you head back to the home page, you can use the **quicklinks** section to navigate to the submissions form. Submit your work there and await grading

<a href="/challenge/stars">Your first challenge is out now!</a>

## Points

Points are awarded as a way to keep progress.
You can find the guide on points <a href="/guide/points"> here</a>.

## Bugs

For better or for worse, this is a project administered and coded all by me. So im sure there are going to be a few hijinks along the way.

If you notice a bug tell me direcetly and score <a href="guide/points">additional points!</a>

I have made the github code public in the footer of this page, but don't look at it too hard because Im sure that your sickness will be positively correlated with time spent viewing the code.

## Advent

Each day return to the advent calendar to score additional points, and gain an overview of the upcoming deliverables and any new work released.

It is acsessible from the home page, or it can also be accessed by clicking the calendar on the home page.

## RULES!

There arent any major rules in this challenge but we expect that everyone will be respectful to one another and not plagarize. Using generative ai is fair game, but if you are going to use chatgpt don't waste other peoples time and make the writing short, concise, relevant and specific. No citation or anything is expected either.

While there are no rules, you may want to still read these guides if you have questions. It ought to give you better idea of how to maximize your time in the challenge.

## Final Words!

Make sure to join the discord. It will serve as the community for this challenge.
And remember that you can find all the links you'd ever need on the home page.

Above all, have fun!
